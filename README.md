# React_Native

**Overview of React Native**

* React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript.

* It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components.

* With React Native, you don't build a mobile web app, an HTML5 app, or a hybrid app; you build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java.

* React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.

## React Native Advantages

Follow are the advantages of React Native −

* JavaScript − You can use the existing JavaScript knowledge to build native mobile apps.

* Code sharing − You can share most of your code on different platforms.

* Community − The community around React and React Native is large, and you will be able to find any answer you need.

* Cross-Platform Usage: Provide facility of "Learn once write everywhere", it works for both platform Android as well iOS devices.

* Class Performance: The code written in React Native are compiled into native code, which enables it for both operating systems as well as it functions in the same way on both the platforms.

## React Native Limitations

* Native Components − If you want to create native functionality which is not created yet, you will need to write some platform specific code.

* Improving with Time: Some features of iOS and Android are still not supported, and the community is always inventing the best practices.

* Existence is Uncertain: As the Facebook develop this framework, its presence is uncertain since it keeps all the rights to kill off the project anytime. As the popularity of React Native rises, it is unlikely to happen.
